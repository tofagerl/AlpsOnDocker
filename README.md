# SatanOnDocker
A docker image configured to hit it and quit it for Satan GH60. 

This image uses the TMK fork from https://github.com/kairyu/tmk_keyboard_custom and automatically compiles any keymaps put into the `keymaps` folder and puts the firmware in the firmware folder. 
Existing firmware will be renamed to avoid dataloss.
